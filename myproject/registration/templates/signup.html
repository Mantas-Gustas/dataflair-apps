<!-- Here we have a general HTML file. The main difference starts in <form> tags. We have two attributes of the form tag: the action which is blank, which means the view function of this page will handle the response and the method, we have specified as the post. If some error arises, try using uppercase POST value.

Then we have used {% csrf_token %}. This is the first time we are using any security features of Django.

CSRF stands for Cross-site Request Forgery and is a type of security threat to websites taking form data. Django provides you built-in support for this, by making it necessary to use this token.

Without CSRF token, your website forms can be filled by bots. But, your web data is at potential risk of going to other websites.

The CSRF token prevents this situation. This field has some value which is randomly generated by your server and that value shall match with your server when the form is submitted. That particular value is also not acceptable by other servers. Thus, web data remains where it should be.

After that, we used <table> tags. Inside that we declared {{ form.as_table }}. This is Djangoâ€™s built-in way of form templating. We can declare this as paragraph and more options are available.

Then we declared a submit button. Clicking this button will submit our form. -->
