"""
In above view function, we have declared forms the same as we declared models. We created a new instance of form class. Then we checked by which method we are receiving our form, whether, itâ€™s POST method or any other method.

This condition is important. It will check whether the user is requesting the form for the first time or has filled data before. When a user demands form for the first time, we receive a GET request but when a user submits data in form, it will happen through POST request. Thus, we will send the right response.
