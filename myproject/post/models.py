class Post(models.Model):

    post_author = models.CharField(max_length = 100, default = 'anonymous')

# Here, Post and Like are two models. We are using the Foreign Key Field. It is used to define many-to-one relationships between models. The post variable in Like model will contain the primary key of the post that we added. Thus, we can then refer to that postâ€™s data. We are not using it in this example though.
